## EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)

### What is an EC2 instance?
An EC2 instance is a virtual server to run software applications.  
It can be auto-scaled to meet increasing workloads to support more and more users.  
It is a fundamental computing solution offered by AWS.

The last step in completing the Day 1 Checklist is knowing how to create an EC2 instance.
