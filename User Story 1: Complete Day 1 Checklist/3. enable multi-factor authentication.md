## Enable Multi-Factor Authentication

Multi-Factor Authentication adds an extra layer of security while you sign-in. It confirms your identity using a code in addition to the password. Lets see how to enable MFA.

Step 1: Go to the IAM dashboard by searching for _iam_ in the search bar. Refer to [create-iam-user](create-iam-user.md) for exact details.

Step 2: Once on the dashboard, you can see **Add MFA for root user**. Click on **Add MFA** next to it.
