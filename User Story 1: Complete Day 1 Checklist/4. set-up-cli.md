## AWS Command Line Interface

Next step is to install the AWS CLI. This tool enables you to interact with AWS services using commands in your command-line shell.

Step 1: Go to the installation [user guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html).   
   Scroll down to the section corresponding to your operating system - MacOS, Windows or Linux.
