> [!NOTE]
When you first create an account, it is for the root user. A root user is the account owner and administrator who has unrestricted access to all AWS resources and services. AWS best practices state that root user should only be used for specific tasks that require it, such as changing account settings, billing management, managing other users etc. Day-to-day tasks should be performed by IAM (Identity and Access Management) users. We will dive into those in the next part.

Step 3: Enter your email address and a chosen account name, and click on **Verify email address**.
