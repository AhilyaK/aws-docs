> [!NOTE]
A root user is the account owner and administrator who has unrestricted access to all AWS resources and services. AWS best practices state that root should only be used for specific tasks that require it, such as changing account settings, billing management, managing other users etc. Daily routine tasks should be performed by IAM (Identity and Access Management) users. We will dive into those shortly.
