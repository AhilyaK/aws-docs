## Enable Multi-Factor Authentication

Multi-Factor Authentication adds an extra layer of security while you sign-in. It confirms your identity using a code in addition to the password. Lets go through the steps to enable MFA.

Step 1: Go to the IAM dashboard by searching for _iam_ in the search bar. Refer to [create-iam-user](create-iam-user.md) for exact details.

Step 2: Once on the dashboard, you will be able see **Add MFA for root user**. Click on **Add MFA** next to it.

Step 3: There are three ways to receive the MFA code. Preffered way is to use an Authenticator application like Authy on the your computer.
Install [Authy](https://authy.com/download/) and then proceed to the next step on the AWS console. 

Step 4: Select MFA device. Give the device a name. Select Authenticator app and click **Next**.

Step 5: To set up the device, copy the secret key by clicking **Show secret key**. Paste it on the app to start receiving codes. Copy two of the consecutive received codes in fields **MFA code 1** and **MFA code 2**. Click **Next**.
