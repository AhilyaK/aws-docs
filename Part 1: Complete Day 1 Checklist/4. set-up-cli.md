## AWS Command Line Interface 

AWS CLI is a tool that enables you to interact with AWS services using commands on your command-line shell.   
Let's go through the steps to set it up.

**Step 1**: Go to the CLI installation [user guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html).   
Scroll down to the section corresponding to your operating system - MacOS, Windows or Linux and follow the steps.    
   Shown below are MacOS instructions.

**Step 2**: Check your installation by opening up the terminal application on your computer and type: 
```
aws --version
```

The output should be similar to the below.    
Newer versions might be released based on when you install so the version numbers may be updated.

You can now control AWS resources by running commands through this interface.
