## What is IAM?
IAM (Identity and Access Management) is an entity offered by AWS to interact with the platform's resources and perform everyday operations. 
It helps securely manage who signs in to the platform and what permissions can be given to them.
IAM is a vast topic and you can read more about it [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/intro-structure.html).
