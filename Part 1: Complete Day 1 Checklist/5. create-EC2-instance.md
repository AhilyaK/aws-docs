## EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)

### What is an EC2 instance?
An EC2 instance is a virtual server to run software applications.    
It is a fundamental computing solution offered by AWS.   
Instances are made up of varying combinations of CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity and give you the flexibility to choose the appropriate mix of resources for your applications.    
They can be auto-scaled to meet increasing workloads to support more and more users.     

The final step in completing the Day 1 Checklist is knowing how to create an EC2 instance.   

**Step 1**: Go to the AWS console and type **ec2**. This opens the EC2 dashboard.
