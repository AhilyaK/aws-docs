# Adding a cost widget to the AWS console

It is possible to customize what you see once you land on the AWS console through the use of widgets.
Adding a cost widget to the console gives a clear picture of the cost and usage data for the current month. 
This is useful in case you have services/instances or any other resources running that you have forgotten to clean up.

You need to enable cost explorer before adding a widget to the dashboard.  

Step 1: Open the AWS Cost Management dashboard [here](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cost-management/home).

In the navigation pane, choose Cost Explorer.

On the Welcome to Cost Explorer page, choose Launch Cost Explorer.
