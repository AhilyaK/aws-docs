# Creating a cost widget on the dashboard

It is possible to customize what you see once you land on the AWS console through the use of widgets.
Adding a cost widget to the console gives a clear picture of the cost and usage data for the current month. 
This is useful in case you have services/instances or any other resources running that you have forgotten to clean up.

You need to enable cost explorer before adding a widget to the dashboard.  

**Step 1**: To enable cost explorer, click [here](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cost-management/home).
As seen, it takes 24 hours to generate cost and usage data.
