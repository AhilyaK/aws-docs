## AWS Free Tier

New users of AWS often land up in situations where sudden bills pop up at the end of the month due to accidental use of paid resources.
Hence it is crucial to know what is included in the free tier and how to monitor the expenses. 
AWS offers three types of free plans:

## Free Trials
These are short term trial offers that start from the time of first usage begins. Once the trial period expires you pay standard, pay-as-you-go service rates.

## 12 Months Free
These offers are only available to new AWS customers, and are available for 12 months following your AWS sign-up date. When your 12 month free usage term expires or if your application use exceeds the tiers, you pay standard, pay-as-you-go service rates.

## Always Free
These offers do not automatically expire at the end of your 12 month AWS Free Tier term, but are available to both existing and new AWS customers indefinitely.

To learn more about what is included in the each category, check out [Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/?all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&all-free-tier.sort-order=asc&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Types=*all&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Categories=*all).

In parts one and three of the documentation, we have described EC2 instances and S3 buckets that are free tier eligible.
Next, we'll see how to enable billing alerts to protect us from surprise expenses.
