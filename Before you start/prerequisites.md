User Stories 1 and 2 are written for beginners wanting to get started with AWS.
Before working through these, make sure you have the the below:
1. A working internet connection.
2. A working credit card for registration. Note that you will not be charged, we will be working with AWS's free tier.
3. A phone number that can be reached via call or text message. This is also needed for registration.


User Story 3 is written for slightly more advanced users.
