## Deploy your application: Part One
This video will guide you to set up the infrastructure for your code or application to run on AWS cloud.</br>

> [!NOTE]
> These are generic steps to deploy any application. (An example used in the presentation is an app for selling used books, but this procedure works for all.)

An outline of the process is as follows:

**Step 1.** Create an EC2 instance</br>
**Step 2.** Create an S3 bucket</br>
**Step 3.** Upload the code file to the S3 bucket</br>
**Step 4.** Connect to the instance</br>
**Step 5.** Install Java on the instance</br>
